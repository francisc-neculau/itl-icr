  besides this one:

* The following data is recorded in InftyCDB-3-A.csv and InftyCDB-3-B.csb.
  Fields 1-7 are separated by commas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ID number of source article
2. 2-byte symbol code (written in hexadecimal, using 4 bytes)
3. sheet id ( = file name of the png file in image folder)
4. cx = left coodinage of the bounding box of the character image
5. cx = top coodinage of the bounding box of the character image
6. Character height of the character image
7. Character width of the character image

Contents of InftyCDB-3-A.txt and InftyCDB-3-B.txt:

  * InftyCDB-3-A.txt (188,752 symbols):

    This database consists of images of symbols in various fonts,
    and was used to train the character recognition engine in
    recent versions of InftyReader (Ver 2.0-2.5).
    Each symbol has been scanned at 400 dpi.  Depending on when it was
    selected, a symbol may have been scanned into a gray image and then 
    converted into binary images using different thresholds to produce 
    character images of different density from one original sample, 
    while some others are scaned directly into binary image from scaner 
    using medium threshold.

    Images of the symbols come from the following three groups:

    (1) The following publications, from various publishers:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. Journal of Approximation Theory (Academic Press)
   2. Journal of Differential Equations (Academic Press)
   3. Journal of Functional Analysis (Academic Press)
   4. Introduction to Algebraic Curves (American Mathematical Society)
   5. 30 Lectures in Mathematics Series: 30 Lectures on Complex Numbers
      (Japanese, Asakura Shoten)
   6. Complexity Theory of Real Functions (Birkhauser)
   7. Journal of Fluid Mechanics (Cambridge University Press)
   8. Image Processing: Mathematical Methods and Applications (Clarendon Press)
   9. Automorphisms of Affine Spaces (Kluwer Academic Publishers)
  10. Typesetting samples (Kotobuki Printing Co.)
  11. Hyperbolic Manifolds and Holomorphic Mappings (Marcel Dekker, Inc.)
  12. Complex Analysis (Springer-Verlag)
  13. Introduction to Complex Hyperbolic Spaces (Springer-Verlag)
  14. Knot Theory (Japanese, Springer-Verlag)
  15. Rational Points on Elliptic Curves  (Springer)
  16. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics (John Wiley & Sons)
  17. Explanation of Braille Codes for Mathematics
      (Japanese, Japanese Braille Association)
  18. Value Distribution Theory (D. Van Nostrand Co.)
  19. An Introduction to Differentials and Integrals (Yuuseisha)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Fonts used internally on Windows and Macintosh computers,
        and LaTeX fonts.  These are entered into the database
        by means of scanned printouts.

    (3) Infrequently appearing symbols and fonts are individually
        sought out from mathematics articles in the Kyushu University
        Library.  To our regret, in these cases there is no record
        of the document source.  However, any two symbols that came
        from the same book are always assigned the same article ID number.


  * InftyCDB-3-B.txt (70,637 symbols):

    From 20 mathematics articles (a subset of those used in Infty-CDB-1),
    all of the symbols are extracted at 600 dpi.
    Initially, samples of every symbol code that differ in size are
    taken.  After feature vectors have been computed, clustering is
    used to reduce the redundancy of the samples.  The samples that are
    selected through clustering are entered into InftyCDB-3-B.

    To make the database convenient for the development and testing
    of OCR engines, symbols that look identical in print have been
    assigned the same symbol code.  When InftyCDB-1 was released,
    the summation symbol $\sum$ (for example) was distinguished from
    the Greek letter $\Sigma$; this time, they are treated as identical.
    However, lower and upper case alphabet letters are always given
    different codes, even if they look nearly identical out of context
    (Cc, Oo, Pp, Ss, Vv, Ww, Xx, etc.).

    Furthemore, symbols that look different but are not distinguished
    in mathematical usage ($\epsilon$ and $\varepsilon$, slanted
    and italic, etc.) are assigned the same code.

    Here is a detailed list of characters that are assigned the same code:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fractional line, underbar, overbar, minus, overline, underline,
      lowline, hyphen, longHyphen

    * Single end quotation (') and comma (,)

    * Tilde (\tilde) and similarity (\sim)

    * Vector symbol (\vec) and right arrow (\rightarrow)

    * The following pairs of TeX entities:

        \sum and \Sigma
        \prod and \Pi
        \bigcup and \cup
        \bigcap and \cap
        \bigvee and \vee
        \bigwedge and \wedge
        \bigoplus and \oplus
        \bigotimes and \otimes
        \varepsilon and \epsilon
        \vartheta and \theta
        \varrho and \rho
        \varsigma and \sigma

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * OcrCodeList.txt

    This is the same list that was included with Infty-CDB-1.
    Each symbol code is two bytes; the first represents the
    category (representing the type of symbol, or the style
    of font), and the second represents a character within that category.
    The file lists all symbol codes in order, along with the corresponding
    category names and LaTeX names.

  * Conditions of use

    This database may be used free of charge in the research,
    development, and testing of OCR systems for scientific documents.
    Please refrain from other forms of use.

    You are permitted to use the database for commercial OCR engines.
    However, if you do use it for such a purpose, you must contact
    the Creator, whose contact information appears below.

    You may not sell this database, or any part of it.
    If you incorporate it into a new distribution, please include
    the database in its entirety, without transformation or
    modification.

    We hope this database will contribute to your development or
    research.  If it does, please include the InftyProject URL
    (http://www.inftyproject.org) with your publication or release.
